I'm a software developer working with Microsoft Dynamics Business Central for the last 8 years.

In that timeframe, I have had the opportunity to work in the implementation and customization of dozens of projects, some as standalone BC, some others as an implementation of LS Central (previously known as LS Retail).

Also, this long time has allowed me to be a part in the evolution of BC, since the days of Dynamics NAV 2009 (remember that one?) until the transformation int Business Central. And the language as well, since we started using C/AL backin the days, and we are using AL nowadays.

So, if the experience I have gathered in all these years can be helful to others, this is where I will try and do that.

If you have any questions you want me to address, you can reach me via my twitter profile, which you can find when you click my name in any post, or in the bottom left corner of this site.

Hope to help.
